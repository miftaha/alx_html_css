# Headphones Landing Page

This project is a front-end web development exercise where I implemented a fully functional web page from scratch using HTML and CSS. The goal was to create a web page that matches a given design file, focusing on applying HTML, CSS, accessibility, and responsive design skills without using any external CSS frameworks or JavaScript.

## Project Overview

In this project, I created a web page that closely follows the provided design specifications. The webpage adapts to different screen sizes, switching to a mobile-friendly layout when the screen width is 480px or less.

### Font Resources

The following fonts were used in this project:

- [**Source Sans Pro**](https://github.com/beabzk/alx_html_css/tree/main/headphones/fonts/source-sans-pro)
- [**Spin Cycle OT**](https://github.com/beabzk/alx_html_css/tree/main/headphones/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT)

### Interactions

- The web page switches to a mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less.
- Links hover/active state: `#FF6565`
- Button hover/active state: `opacity: 0.9`
- Maximum width of the content is 1000px, centered on the page.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several sections, each building upon the previous one:

### Header

The header/hero section was created using the provided assets. This section includes a navigation menu and a hero image with overlay text and a call-to-action button.

## Advanced Features

The project was further enhanced with advanced CSS techniques and animations:

### Pentagon Shapes with CSS

Instead of using image files, the pentagons in the "Our results" section were created using pure HTML and CSS. This demonstrates advanced CSS shape-drawing capabilities.

**Files:**

- `6-index.html`
- `6-styles.css`

### Animations

To make the page more engaging, animations were added to the "What we do..." and "Our results" sections. These animations provide visual feedback and enhance user interaction.

- Items in the "What we do..." section scale and rotate slightly on hover.
- Pentagons in the "Our results" section have a bouncing animation.

**Files:**

- `7-index.html`
- `7-styles.css`
